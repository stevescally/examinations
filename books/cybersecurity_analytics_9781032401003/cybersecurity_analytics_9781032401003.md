# Summary (Publisher)

This book organizes in one place the mathematics, probability, statistics
machine learning information and text processing information that is required
for a practitioner of cybersecurity analytics, as well as the basics of
cybersecurity needed for a practitioner.

# Chapter 2: What is Data Analytics?

Data Analytics

1. Ingestion;
2. Cleaning;
3. Visualization and Exploratory Analysis;
4. Feature Extraction and Selection;
5. Modeling;
6. Evaluation;
7. Inference.

Inference also referred to as exploitation or decision making is the ultimate
goal of analysis and drives all the previous steps. This is the topic that the
rest of the book covers.

This chapter lays out basic ideas and topics related to cybersecurity analysis.

## 2.4 Pattern Recognition

Different types of classifications are needed as malware, insider threat, unusual 
network activity and network sessions will have unique profiles to each situation.

* Classification(Supervised learning)
* Clustering(Unsupervised learning)

## 2.5.1 Feature Selection

Two methods:

1. True Selection
  - Select a subset of the features among all features measured.
2. Projection / Embedding 
  - Compute linear/nonlinear combinations of the features, and select
    a small set of combinations.

# Chapter 3: Security: Basics and Security Analytics

Stepping-stone detection
  
  - Intermiediate hosts that are on the path from attacker to victim.
  - Detecting this type of attack is difficult as there maybe numerous paths.

  Sources:
  - Detection of interactive stepping stones: Algorithms and confidence bounds. (RAID pg. 258-277)
  - Neural networks-based detection of stepping-stone intrusion. (Expert Syst. Appl. 37(2) pg.1431-1437)

Credit card / financial fraud

  - ISO 8583 framework for financial transaction protocols
    - Are there similarities between network traffic / usage?
    - Can similar techniques be applied to the network sessions?

(Distributed)Denial of Service (D)DoS

  - Can the below methods be used over collected session data?
  - Statistical methods to look at:
    - wavelet analysis
    - change point detection
