# Understanding

* Mathematics provides the best method to model the types of data we observe and analyze in Cybersecurity
* Major areas statistics, graph theory, game theory... (calculus for rate of changes?)
* "This book is designed for the cybersecurity analyst who wishes to create new techniques that have a secure foundation in math."

## Set Operations
  * Set: is collection of objects or members
  * Empty Set: contains no members and is a member of all sets
  * Size: number of elements in a set
  * Subset: is a set that has all of its objects also within another set
  * Superset: is a set that contains all members of another set
  * Powerset: is all possible subsets of a set
  * Complement: is all the superset members not contained within a subset
  * Intersection: is objects that exist in two or more different sets
  * Commutativity: the intersection of sets has equal members
  * Disjoint: the interesection of sets that contains no members (emtpy)
  * Union: combinations of all objects in two or more sets
  * Difference: is objects that exist only in one set being compared to another set
  * Symmetric Difference: is set of objects that are only found in their set and no other set (opposite of an intersection)
  * Cartesian product / cross product: a new set that contains all members of of all sets under consideration
