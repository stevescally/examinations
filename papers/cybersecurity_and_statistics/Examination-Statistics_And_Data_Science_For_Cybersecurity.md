# Understanding

* Attackers hold the advantage of diverse networks and associated systems
  which creates gaps in network and application security.
* Centralized enterprise networks have known system which makes it
  easier to track devices.
* IoT and adhoc networks deal with random assortments of devices 
  which requires a different method of attack detection.
* New cybersecurity defenses will need predictive models to detect
  novel malware and software exploitation
* Data driven security approaches have three categories:
    1. Network
    2. Endpoint Detection 
    3. Application-centric
* Reliable domain relevant data is difficult to obtain without EDA
    - Pre-processing tedious and error prone.
* Anomaly detection involves:
    1. Stochastic modeling
    2. Dynamic graphs
    3. Statistical control concepts
